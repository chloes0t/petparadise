Pet Paradise -- A Front-End Website for an Online Pet Supply Store
---
Working on this website helped solidify my skills in html and css, particularly in topics such as css variables, media queries, and flexbox. 
I intend to make the backend code a seperate respository, because GitHub Pages does not support backend.
Thank you for viewing!
